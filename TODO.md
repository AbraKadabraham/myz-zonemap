For graphic background maps that have labels outside of the actual zones [so in the border of the map]: Would it be possible to show borders or graphic areas outside the actual zones?

Also it would be nice to be able to pick Enviroment from a scroll-down menu, which then prompt rerolls ruins and other values [because when you have custom map, you want the enviroment to match map]

When you have to adapt several dozens of sectors to right enviroment remember the correct option [needed for 3 letters] and then 'waiting a few seconds' is quite long..

Alternative would be to edit the JSON file, but the json file only saves 'opened sectors'. Perhaps an option to completely 'pre-generate' the whole zone [so that you can adapt in Json]? 

Please number zones with double digits: eg A01 instead of A1, because when searching in JSON for A1 you also get A10 and A11 etc..

I'd consider the enviroment more important information than the presence of bullet/grub/water. When observed from distance the enviroment can be discerned by players and thus is nice information for the GM to have at hand.

The presence of bullter/grub/water is almost garanteed and only needed when players actively explore the ruins. The icons for it are thus a bit overkill and make other icons hard to distinghuish. 

Please indicate how many threats are in a sector [or its threath value], so that the GM can 'hint' how dangerous a neighboring sector is..
[or color code like Rot]

Also perhaps remove the 3xclick sub-menu in the sector menu. You often want to be in all three anyway and just need to click extra instead of scroll.

Love this tool [hence my comments]

It's a GM only tool at the moment. If you want players to look at it you need each icon hideable for the 'Player map'.
A nice option would be icons for sector enviroment :)
An Icon for 'cleared out' would be nice. [so you see difference between 'there is no longer an artifact here because you already found it and thus no longer can use your stalker stunt' and 'there was no artifact here, but you can still try to search for it'. 

Dont know if this is bug. But when I click the 'dice' button next to Threath level, I expect those number of dice shown to be rolled and number of threats and artifacts to be generated. But instead the threath level is regenerated.
Nicest would be a 'base threat level', with roll option to (re)generate number of threats and artifacts [when generating the sector this can already have been done for first time]. A little option box for 'night' would be nice as well, since that wont affect the base threat level..

Different icons for the different threat types would be nice as well :)

Also allow the threats only to be rerolled [because sometimes you dont want that particular threath for that session]. And it would help if a double click on the threat would give a full description :)

And if you want really nice :) Add random rolled scrap as well :)

And where can we find you after Google+ disappearance.. there is no contact option on the site :(
